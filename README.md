top left - i mixed two colors to form a slow gradual gradient along the Y axis

top right - i interpolated between two colors 

bottom left - i set the wireframe to true 

bottom right - i set the specular to green 

## Lab 4

- What is the formula given a u value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the x value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?



- What is the formula given a v value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the y value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?



- What color is sampled from the texture at the uv coordinate (0.375, 0.25)? (sample from the image based on the number your formula gives you i.e. (1, 0) is blue)
