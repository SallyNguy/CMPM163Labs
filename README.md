I changed the entire theme of the dessert racetrack to a desert themed racetrack. I imported models and placed them around the track as part of the scenery outside the road. All models are not mine.

- What is the formula given a u value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the x value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?

u = x * 0.14

- What is the formula given a v value of the uv coordinate (a value between 0 and 1), I get the y value of the pixel to sample from in this 8x8 texture?

y = v * 0.14

- What color is sampled from the texture at the uv coordinate (0.375, 0.25)? (sample from the image based on the number your formula gives you i.e. (1, 0) is blue)

black

top left - I scaled the image down and placed each image in every corner in the fragment shader

top right - I used the fragment shader to output the texture 

bottom left -  Along with the texture, I loaded it with a normal map onto another cube

bottom middle - I loaded the texture onto the cube with the phong material 

bottom right - Along with the texture, I loaded it with a normal map

## Lab 3:

top left - i mixed two colors to form a slow gradual gradient along the Y axis

top right - i interpolated between two colors 

bottom left - i set the wireframe to true 

bottom right - i set the specular to green
